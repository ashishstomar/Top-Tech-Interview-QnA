/*
  âœ… Problem Statement:
  Given a date (day, month, year), determine the day of the week on which that date falls.
  Return values from 0 to 6 where:
    0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, ..., 6 = Saturday.

  ðŸ”¸ Valid for any date in the past or future.

  ðŸ”¸ Approach:
    Use Zeller's Congruence, an algorithm to calculate the day of the week for any Gregorian calendar date.

  ðŸ”¸ Time Complexity: O(1) â€“ Constant time arithmetic operations
  ðŸ”¸ Space Complexity: O(1)

  let K = year % 100; // Year of the century
